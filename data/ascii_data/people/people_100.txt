What's going on here?========================================================================    You're probably reading this because it's been posted to    news:alt.ascii-art, news:alt.ascii-art.animation or rec.arts.ascii.    If you're not, jump in and take a look.  In these Usenet groups    people discuss ASCII art, request ASCII art, post ASCII art, post    improved versions or variations of other people's ASCII art, and    generally have fun.========================================================================[2]  What is ASCII art?========================================================================    ASCII art is any sort of pictures or diagrams drawn with the    printable characters in the ASCII character set.    (For a definition of ASCII, see Question 3.)    :-) Probably the most common ASCII art picture is the smiley (-:    =)  but it can get a lot more sophisticated than that.        (=               ____            .-" +' "-.      Here's a small ASCII picture of           /.'.'A_'*`.\     a snow-scene paperweight,          |:.*'/\-\.

Here are some of them.    *   It is the most universal computer art form in the world --        every computer system capable of displaying multi-line text can        display ASCII art, without needing to have a graphics mode or        support a particular graphics file format.    *   An ASCII picture is hundreds of times smaller in file size        than its GIF or BMP equivalent, while still giving a good idea        of what something looks like.    *   It's easy to copy from one file to another (just cut and paste).    *   It's fun!========================================================================[3]  What does ASCII mean?========================================================================    ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)      7-bit as defined in ISO-646 is a basic set of 128 numbered symbols      which almost all kinds of computer can display. Here are the ones      that are used for ASCII art:    032 [space] 048 0   064 @   080 P   096 `   112 p    033 !       049 1   065 A   081 Q   097 a   113 q    034 "       050 2   066 B   082 R   098 b   114 r    035 #       051 3   067 C   083 S   099 c   115 s    036 $       052 4   068 D   084 T   100 d   116 t    037 %       053 5   069 E   085 U   101 e   117 u    038 &       054 6   070 F   086 V   102 f   118 v    039 '       055 7   071 G   087 W   103 g   119 w    040 (       056 8   072 H   088 X   104 h   120 x    041 )       057 9   073 I   089 Y   105 i   121 y    042 *       058 :   074 J   090 Z   106 j   122 z    043 +       059 ;   075 K   091 [   107 k   123 {    044 ,       060 <   076 L   092 \   108 l   124 |    045 -       061 =   077 M   093 ]   109 m   125 }    046 .       062 >   078 N   094 ^   110 n   126 ~    047 /       063 ?   079 O   095 _   111 o    There are other characters in the set (with the numbers 0 - 31 and    127), but they can do bad stuff to Usenet readers, so PLEASE DON'T    USE THEM in your pictures (except characters 10 and or 13 which    are used to insert a new-line by a variety of Operating Systems).========================================================================[4]  Why do the pictures look strange?========================================================================    If one particular picture posted to this group looks faulty, but the    rest of them look fine, then its most likely a problem with that    particular picture, or with the poster's Usenet program. But if    *all* the pictures look bad, then your Usenet reader may be set to    display messages in a proportional font (see Question 5).    *   If using Google-Groups from a web-browser try "uBlock Origin" a        plugin for user style-sheets so you can use the following to fix        the layout when using Chrome or FireFox by inserting these lines        in "My filters" in the settings:groups.google.com##div[role="region"]:style(white-space:pre!important)groups.google.com##div[role="region"]:style(font-family:monospace)groups.google.com##div[role="region"] br:style(display:none!important)    *   If there are a lot of almost-blank lines in the picture, then        the message is probably suffering from `wrapping'. This        wrapping may be being done by your newsreader; see if it has an        option called `wrap long lines' or similar, and make sure it is        turned off. If this doesn't work, then the wrapping was probably        done by the news program of the person who sent the picture, in        which case there's not much you can do -- everybody else will be        seeing the same thing.    *   If there are a lot of < and > symbols in the  picture, with        words like HTML, FONT COLOR, B, I, and so on inside them, then        the picture has been sent in HTML format and your newsreader        does not understand HTML (most newsreaders don't).========================================================================[5]  What font do you use for ASCII art?========================================================================    ASCII art is created using a fixed-width font (like on a traditional    typewriter), because this is the only way to make it portable.    However, several Usenet readers now display messages in a    proportional font (where different characters are different widths).    When using proportional fonts you can never be sure whether your    image will look the same in a different proportional font. If you're    making art in Arial and the receiver has Times New Roman or whatever    then perhaps their space character will be wider but their semicolon    is narrower and then things don't line up properly.    The following two lines tell you which kind of font you're using.    The arrow ends up in a different place for different font types and    is right most of the time:    You are using a [Proportional] [Monospaced] font    ................................. --^--    Also, to see what your program is doing, look at these two lines:    iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii|    WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW|    If they look the same length, you're using a fixed-width font and    all should be ok. If the second line is longer than the first, you    need to change your settings to use a fixed-width font.        In Mozilla Thunderbird, the option is set in           Tools > Options > Language & Appearance        In Forte Agent, the option is set in           Options > Display Preferences > Fonts        and Free Agent, the option is set in           Options > General Preferences > Fonts        In Outlook, the option is set in           Tools > Options > Read > Fonts                       ____           Tools > Options > Send > Automatically wrap text at |____|        set both the PROPORTIONAL font and FIXED-WIDTH font to        LUCIDA CONSOLE, and FONT SIZE to SMALLER    --------------------------------------------------------------------    NOTE : If LUCIDA CONSOLE is not available as a font, pick another           such as CONSOLAS or COURIER NEW    --------------------------------------------------------------------    Detailed information on how to configure other Usenet readers is    available at the:  ASCII-Art Documentation Archive.    If all else fails, copy the text of the picture from    your program and paste it into a text editor (such as Notepad).    It's a hassle, but at least you'll get to see the pictures.========================================================================[6]  What program do you use for ASCII art?========================================================================    You can create ASCII art in any text editor,     [jorn barger]    such as: Notepad in Windows,    SimpleText or BBEdit in MacOS,    nedit, vi, vim, or pico in Unix,                   _+m"m+_    BEd or AZ in AmigaOS, edit in DOS,                Jp     qh    or any of the various Emacs editors.              O       O                                                      Yb     dY    A  'quick-start'  program  for learning            "Y5m2Y"    is JavE, a free Java program, that can be    obtained from:-          http://www.jave.de    Some editors have features which make them more    suitable for  ASCII art  than others, but that is    largely a matter of personal opinion. Features which    are both useful for  ASCII art  and  available in many    text editors, include the following:-    *   Overtype, also known as overstrike: removes the need for        you to constantly realign characters using the  Backspace,        Space, and Delete keys. Try the  Insert key if there is one        on your keyboard,  or  your program's Options or Preferences.    *   Rectangular copy and paste: allows you to select rectangular        sections of text (not just rows or parts of rows). On programs        which have this feature, it is usually done by holding down a        key such as Ctrl while selecting text.    *   Find/Change: allows you to change all the characters of one        value to another (eg: change all the ~s to "s).========================================================================[7]  How do I draw my own ASCII art?========================================================================    Unfortunately, there aren't many text books on the subject. :-)    A good way to learn is to study how someone has made a picture.    What characters are chosen and how the characters are laid out.    How a texture is made.    ########:::::::::::########   The best way to learn is to Practise.    #########:::::::::#########   Draw your cat, your toaster, your    ##########:::::::##########   partner, your musical instruments,    ###########,---.###########   anything that will sit still long    ##########/`---'\##########   enough.

Try:  https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~vk/cgi-bin/ASCII/plastic-bag.cgi    You can also modify existing art. Take a piece of art you think    could be improved.  Make a copy.  Now work on it.  When you are    good at that, try to improve a really good pic. Then see if you    can fix a damaged file.  Now take some small pics and put them    together into a big composite image.    Much of ASCII art is about hinting, and making people see lines    that aren't really there.[VK]    When drawing ASCII art be aware that there are a few characters    that differ in size, shape and position among fonts:    ' apostrophe -- tilts southwest-northeast or vertical    * asterisc   -- appears in the middle or top    ^ caret      -- differs in size and shape    ~ tilde      -- appears in the middle or top    I aye        -- straight line in sans-serif, with strokes in serif                    try using the vertical bar (|) instead.    # hash       -- hash symbol on most, currency on some old computers.========================================================================[8]  Can someone do me some kewl lettering?========================================================================    There is a program called Figlet which does that sort of thing    automatically -- you type in `Jane Smith', and you get back        ___              __,       ( /              (          o _/_ /        / __,  _   _     `.  _ _  ,  /  /_      _/_(_/(_/ /_(/_  (___)/ / /_(_(__/ /_     //    (/                                        [figlet:cursive.flf]    in this and a whole lot of other fonts (see Question 9).    The ASCII art text produced by Figlet can be quite stunning,    so try it first before asking for help from the newsgroups.    IF, however, Figlet doesn't produce the kind of results you want,    THEN post to alt.ascii-art or rec.arts.ascii with your request and    ensure that you include:    *    that you have already tried Figlet or don't have access to it         otherwise you will probably just get told to use it.    *    a description of the kind of lettering you want, along with         any other symbols or logos which you would like incorporated         into it.========================================================================[9]  Where can I find Figlet ?========================================================================    The Figlet home page is at:-   http://www.figlet.org/    and links to the FTP site:-     ftp://ftp.figlet.org/pub/figlet/    where you can download    versions of the program or source-code for many different platforms.

DO NOT remove these initials -- would you cut away the part of        a Van Gogh painting containing his name?  Leaving the initials        on is a small price to pay for being able to use the picture        for free.    *   If you're going to use a picture in your signature file, or in        a place (such as a log-in screen) which means you're going to        be using it a lot, you should really e-mail the artist (or post        to the newsgroup, if you don't know their address) and ask for        permission, because otherwise people may get the mistaken        impression that you were the one who drew the picture.    *   If you find a picture you want to use, or post, but it doesn't        have initials on it, a common method of marking has been to use        the tag: Unknown. More recently the tag: [nosig] has been used.    As for posting other people's ASCII art,    after a discussion in news:alt.ascii-art       _     ___    the following rules were agreed upon:         #_~`--'__ `===-,    1.  If an ASCII ART picture has initials      `.`.     `#.,//        on it, leave them on when posting it      ,_\_\     ## #\    2.  If an ASCII ART picture doesn't have      `__.__    `####\        initials on it,  mention  that  you            ~~\ ,###'~        didn't  draw  it  when  posting  it.              \##'    3.  If somebody  posts a picture without                  [nosig]        initials and you have an original copy        with initials on, feel free to re-post the original version.        *   The re-post ought not to be taken personally, as we all            know that ASCII art often loses proper credits.            Responses to the re-post are not necessary.    One contributor suggested the following:    1.) Ultra polite:...ya make yer own ascii and use it.    2.)  Very polite:...Ya contact the author and ask if ya                        can use it...    3.)       polite:...Ya use it but you keep the Credits                        in there like they should be.    4.)         rude:...Ya use it and strip credits.    5.)    Very rude:...Ya use it and claim that it Is                        _Your_ very own creation...    You choose ... I think the default choice is #3 but you should    make up yer own mind....   [Krogg]========================================================================[11]  What way works best to ask for a picture of something?========================================================================    Give your request the subject:  `REQ:' or `[req]'    Whatever you're looking for a picture of, in the message describe    more exactly what you're looking for. Generally, the more specific    you are, the more likely you are to get some response.    If you just say something like:         `can someone draw me a fish, please'    then you may not get many replies, because people may not know    what size or feel they're wasting their time by drawing something    you won't want. If you don't have Web access, mention this fact,    otherwise you may get replies consisting only of URLs for the    kind of pictures you're looking for.    If someone is rude back to you directly, then please be patient,    since it may just be a troll trying to wind you up.          __        .'  ))  __-:!:-                If you have a picture          .'  .'  ))                   and want it Ascii-fied        ((__,'  .'  .ASCII! -:!:-      see Question 14 and 15.        -:!:- ((__,'^*========================================================================[12]  What should I know before posting to alt.ascii-art?========================================================================    It doesn't matter if your ASCII art isn't particularly good; we'd    like to see it anyway. We won't be rude about it (although you'd    better tell us what it is, or we might ask :-), but if it shows    potential, you may find that other people will `re-diddle' it --    change a few characters, make it a bit better, and re-post it.    HOWEVER, there are a few things you should check before you    post to news:alt.ascii-art any piece of ASCII art    (see also Question 13).    *   Are you sending it as PLAIN TEXT?        Turn off "send MIME message" and select "PLAIN TEXT only".    *   Is it under 72 characters wide? Most news readers can only show        lines which are under either 72, 76, or 80 characters wide, so        if your picture is wider than 72 characters it may get wrapped        [see Question 4]. Also remove any unnecessary space characters        from the end of each line of the picture, to prevent lines from        being too long (and getting wrapped) without your realizing.    *   If it IS over 72 characters wide?        Then a warning in the subject line [wide:110] or whatever the        original picture width and Check Your Post Output Line-Wrap        settings.        Previous versions of this FAQ used a system to prefix posts        such as: [pic] [info] [req] [big] which may be used as a guide        when providing warnings.    *   Sometimes a newsreader program may remove leading spaces from        the first line of a posting which can be resolved by placing        a dot '.' on a line of its own above the message.    *   Sometimes a newsreader program may remove a single leading space        from a posting which can be resolved by ensuring there are at        least two leading spaces on each line of the message.    *   Sometimes a newsreader program may insert extra spaces at the        start of lines which already had a space char due to a default        setting: Format=flowed  -  which needs to be turned off.        The mailers affected are:-            Mozilla Mail (including Thunderbird)            M2 (the Opera mail program),  Eudora 4.2 and later,            Microsoft Hotmail,  Apple Mail,  Pine 4.61 and later.        Also the 'quote' functions are a hazzard when viewing Ascii Art.    *   Have you used any TAB characters or Control Codes?        Inserting control codes (ASCII characters 0 to 31) in a picture        can sometimes achieve interesting effect on your computer screen        or news reader, such as reversing text or changing its colour.        DO NOT post any of these pictures to news:alt.ascii-art, post to        news:alt.binaries.pictures.ascii instead for two reasons:-        1.  the effects that the control codes have on your news reader            are almost certainly going to be  different  from those on            the thousands of other news readers that other people use        2.  on some news readers, control codes can cause  messed up            displays, messages not appearing, or (in some cases) the            news reader crashing.    If you're not sure about whether your message will turn out ok,    post it to a test group (such as news:alt.test or news:misc.test)    first and make sure that you can read it ok, also using a different    newsreader, if you can.

Many computer systems have an extended character set of 256 or        more characters, based on the ANSI, Unicode or BIG5 character        sets and having the first 128 characters possibly identical to        ASCII. These characters should not be sent to news:alt.ascii-art        because many computer system types do not display them properly,        even those that do, do not display them in a standard way, for        example, the Windows ANSI character set is different to the        Macintosh ANSI character set. Capture and send a GIF of it to        news:alt.binaries.pictures.ascii or put it on a Web page and        post a reference to it to news:alt.ascii-art.    *   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) which Web pages are written in        can be read by some Usenet readers, particularly those built-in        to Web browsers, allowing colours and animations in ASCII art,        however, few newsreaders support it and to many appears as a         jumble of <TAGS> and are totally unrecognizable,        If you have a picture which uses HTML for a particular feature        such as colors or animation, put it on a Web page and post        the URL address of the page to news:alt.ascii-art.    *   JAVA, JavaScript, Flash, GIF or whatever animated ASCII art.        This relies, not only on the newsreader being able to display        HTML, but also being able to run Java or JavaScript.        Put it on a Web page and post the URL address to        news:alt.ascii-art.animation and news:alt.ascii-art    *   Proportional Font ASCII art screws up on many readers' displays        Post it to news:rec.arts.ascii (see Section[13.2]).

That work is done by a    robo-moderator which filters Spam and checks the posts have the    correct format before approving them.  It can also target a    specific poster's traffic for human moderator approval.    Subjects must be tagged either:    [PIC] for pictures    [REQ] for requests for others to draw pictures          (people replying with pictures change the tag to [PIC])    [DIS] for general ascii art related discussion and replies.

If you saw the picture on a Web page, you can find out its URL by    right-clicking on it (on the Macintosh, right-clicking,    Ctrl-clicking, or holding down the mouse button) and selecting    `Open this image' (or its equivalent for your Web browser), then    copy the URL from the Location bar to your news program (make sure    you copy it exactly).    If the picture is not on a Web site anywhere, put it up on your own    site (if you have one), or get a friend to put it up on their site,    and post the URL to alt.ascii-art. If you can't do this, post your    request to the newsgroups and wait for someone to reply, then post    the picture to news:alt.binaries.pictures.ascii or e-mail to them.========================================================================[15]  How do I convert a picture to ASCII art?========================================================================[15.1] programs:    There are computer programs available which convert graphics files    of a variety of formats (often GIF) to ASCII art. They go by names    such as ascgif, gifa, gifscii, and gif2ascii.  Do a Web search for    any of these programs to find places where you can download them.    Try:        http://www.jave.de/.        http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib    Many think that you just put a GIF into a converter program and    out comes a perfect ASCII pic.  Here are some things you can do    to improve the chances of getting a good conversion:-    o   Use an 8 bit grey scale or color image instead of a 2 bit B&W.    o   Use an image with a wide, even distribution of tones.    o   Keep it simple, like a face or close-up of an object.    o   Avoid busy backgrounds.  Generally avoid bright backgrounds.    o   Use an image that is tightly cropped, without a lot of waste.    o   Be prepared to quickly run through a series of conversions,        you will probably not like 9 to 11 out of 12.    o   It helps to do touch-up work on the converted picture,        concentrate on the focal points and important areas.[15.2] tracing:    Another method is by tracing a picture, either onto clear-plastic    and sticking it onto the screen then opening an editor to trace    under or using an editor which allows the loading of a background    image to trace over, a process known as `water-mark'.    Try:  https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~vk/cgi-bin/ASCII/plastic-bag.cgi[15.3] image2html:    There are computer programs and web-servers available which convert    graphics files of a variety of formats to HTML colored TEXT art for    use on web-pages.

Usually it contains little more    than the person's name, organization and e-mail address, maybe an    inspirational quote of some sort and some people like to incorporate    ASCII art into their signature files as well.        _ _      _    _ _  _ ___ ___           \|/ ____ \|/       | | | ___| |  (_) \| | __/ __|           @~/ ,. \~@       |_  _|___| |__| | .` | _|\__ \          /_( \__/ )_\ Mike         |_|    |____|_|_|\_|___|___/[Figlet]     \__U_/    Jittlov    The lack of importance in relation to global warming, violence in    society, and so on, can be the subject of heated arguments. To be    brief, (almost) no-one will complain if your signature file is four    lines long or fewer -- and it is quite possible to draw good ASCII    pictures which are that small.

Five or six    lines may be acceptable, but  any longer, and you're starting to    take the risk that your signature will be longer than some of your    messages; this wouldn't really make sense on paper, so it isn't    really acceptable in cyberspace either.

Here is an example of how they break down by light intensity:       (Jorn Barger's light value scale)                    Darker    .'`,^:";~    Lighter           bright    /|\      -_+<>i!lI?     /|\      dark          letters     |       /\|()1{}[]      |     letters             on               rcvunxzjft               on            dark      |       LCJUYXZO0Q      |      bright         background  \|/      oahkbdpqwm     \|/   background                    Lighter   *WMB8&%$#@   Darker    o  3-D images - Can be viewable by people with similar vision in       both eyes. You try to focus as if you are looking at the back       of the monitor. The image should pop into focus and create a       3-D illusion. Other 3-D images are viewed by putting your nose       on the monitor glass.    o  Geometric Article - Text is formed into meaningful shapes.    o  Picture Poem - A geometric article that is also a poem.    o  Page Making - Text and graphics are intermixed, as in a magazine.    o  Picture Story - A story told with accompanying ASCII pictures.    o  Color - You can view color ASCII pics, if you have a color screen       and 'ANSI' color compatible software, or Web access using HTML.    o  Color Graphics - You can view color ASCII pics if you have color    o  Animation - take a look at         [dead-link snipped]    o  Color Animation - take a look at   [dead-link snipped]    o  Scroll Animation - This is an animation that is made to be viewed       by scrolling down.  The image plays out as the screen is redrawn       with the next 'page' of the image.    o  Overstrike Art - It contains carriage returns without line feeds       at times. The print head can overstrike a line on the paper that       has already been printed on.  This allows for darkening, and for       placing different characters at the same place on the paper.       This kind of art is obviously only printed.8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888.._|      | `-.  | `.  -_-_ _-_  _-  _- -_ -  .'|   |.'|     |  _..8888   `-.._  |    |`!  |`.  -_ -__ -_ _- _-_-  .'  |.;'   |   _.!-'|  8888      | `-!._  |  `;!  ;. _______________ ,'| .-' |   _!.i'     |  8888..__  |     |`-!._ | `.| |_______________||."'|  _!.;'   |     _|..8888   |``"..__ |    |`";.| i|_|MMMMMMMMMMM|_|'| _!-|   |   _|..-|'    8888   |      |``--..|_ | `;!|l|MMoMMMMoMMM|1|.'j   |_..!-'|     |     8888   |      |    |   |`-,!_|_|MMMMP'YMMMM|_||.!-;'  |    |     |     8888___|______|____!.,.!,.!,!|d|MMMo * loMM|p|,!,.!.,.!..__|_____|_____8888      |     |    |  |  | |_|MMMMb,dMMMM|_|| |   |   |    |      |  8888      |     |    |..!-;'i|r|MPYMoMMMMoM|r| |`-..|   |    |      |  8888      |    _!.-j'  | _!,"|_|M<>MMMMoMMM|_||!._|  `i-!.._ |      |  8888     _!.-'|    | _."|  !;|1|MbdMMoMMMMM|l|`.| `-._|    |``-.._  |  8888..-i'     |  _.''|  !-| !|_|MMMoMMMMoMM|_|.|`-. | ``._ |     |``"..8888   |      |.|    |.|  !| |u|MoMMMMoMMMM|n||`. |`!   | `".    |     8888   |  _.-'  |  .'  |.' |/|_|MMMMoMMMMoM|_|! |`!  `,.|    |-._|     8888  _!"'|     !.'|  .'| .'|[@]MMMMMMMMMMM[@] \|  `. | `._  |   `-._  8888-'    |   .'   |.|  |/| /                 \|`.  |`!    |.|      |`-8888      |_.'|   .' | .' |/                   \  \ |  `.  | `._-Lee|  8888     .'   | .'   |/|  /                     \ |`!   |`.|    `.  |  8888  _.'     !'|   .' | /                       \|  `  |  `.    |`.|  8888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888========================================================================[X1]-------------------THE ASCII ART FAQ TEN COMMANDMENTS-------------------             \\\\`///             /  _  _|                1.
